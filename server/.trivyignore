# Trivy Ignore File
# This file contains CVEs that have been reviewed and are either:
# 1. False positives
# 2. Not applicable to our use case
# 3. Already mitigated through other means

# Alpine Linux vulnerabilities that are mitigated through regular updates
# These are often false positives due to version detection issues

# Node.js vulnerabilities that don't affect our usage pattern
# (uncomment specific CVEs after careful review)

# Note: Only add CVEs here after careful review and confirmation that they don't pose a risk
# Always prefer fixing vulnerabilities over ignoring them
