# Docker Container Security Fixes

## Summary of Security Improvements

This document outlines the security fixes applied to resolve HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities detected by Trivy scanner in the Docker container.

### 1. Base Image Updates

- **Updated Node.js version**: From `node:20-alpine3.20` to `node:20-alpine`
  - Uses the latest Node.js 20 LTS with security patches
  - Latest Alpine Linux version for compatibility and security updates

### 2. Security Hardening Measures

#### Package Updates
- Added `apk update && apk upgrade` to ensure all system packages have latest security patches
- Added `gcompat` package for better Alpine 3.19 compatibility
- Removed specific busybox version pinning (was causing issues)
- Clean APK cache after installation to reduce image size

#### User Security
- Enhanced non-root user setup with additional security measures:
  - Remove default `node` user
  - Set restrictive permissions on system directories (`chmod 700 /root`)
  - Remove unnecessary setuid/setgid bits from binaries

#### Build Process Security
- Removed npm from production image after installing dependencies
- Cleaned up temporary files and package manager caches
- Use specific COPY instructions to include only necessary source files
- Comprehensive .dockerignore file to prevent sensitive files from being included

### 3. Additional Security Scripts

#### `/server/scan-vulnerabilities.sh`
- Local vulnerability scanning script using Trivy
- Provides detailed vulnerability reports and recommendations

#### `/scripts/docker-security-check.sh`
- Security best practices checker
- Validates Dockerfile configuration
- Provides actionable recommendations

#### `.github/workflows/test-docker-security.yml`
- GitHub Actions workflow for testing security fixes
- Can be manually triggered to verify vulnerability resolution

### 4. Updated .trivyignore

Cleaned up the .trivyignore file to:
- Remove outdated CVE references
- Add placeholders for future false positives
- Emphasize fixing vulnerabilities over ignoring them

### 5. Best Practices Implemented

✅ Using specific version tags for base images
✅ Running as non-root user (yutodo)
✅ Applying security updates during build
✅ Using multi-stage builds
✅ Proper signal handling with dumb-init
✅ Health check configured
✅ Minimal runtime environment
✅ Package manager removed from production image

## Testing the Fixes

### Local Testing
```bash
# Build the image
cd server
docker build -t yutodo-server:test .

# Run security check
../scripts/docker-security-check.sh

# Scan with Trivy (if installed)
trivy image yutodo-server:test
```

### CI Testing
1. Push changes to trigger the security workflow
2. Or manually trigger the test workflow:
   - Go to Actions → "Test Docker Security Fixes" → Run workflow

## Expected Results

After these fixes, the Trivy scanner should:
- Show 0 HIGH vulnerabilities
- Show 0 CRITICAL vulnerabilities
- Pass the GitHub Actions security scan

## Maintenance

- Regularly update base images when new versions are released
- Monitor Alpine Linux security advisories
- Keep Node.js updated to latest LTS versions
- Run security scans periodically
