## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **Email**: Send details to the repository maintainers via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
3. **Include**: 
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested mitigation (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Response within 24 hours

## üöÄ Incident Response

### Detection
1. **Automated Monitoring**: 24/7 security monitoring
2. **User Reports**: Community vulnerability reporting
3. **Third-party Alerts**: External security research

### Response Phases

#### 1. Assessment (0-2 hours)
- Verify vulnerability authenticity
- Determine impact and scope
- Classify severity level
- Assign response team

#### 2. Containment (2-6 hours)
- Implement immediate mitigations
- Prevent further exploitation
- Preserve evidence for analysis
- Communicate with stakeholders

#### 3. Eradication (6-24 hours)
- Develop and test patches
- Remove vulnerability root cause
- Update security controls
- Validate fix effectiveness

#### 4. Recovery (24-48 hours)
- Deploy patches to production
- Monitor for regression issues
- Restore normal operations
- Update security documentation

#### 5. Lessons Learned (1 week)
- Conduct post-incident review
- Update security procedures
- Improve detection capabilities
- Share knowledge with team
